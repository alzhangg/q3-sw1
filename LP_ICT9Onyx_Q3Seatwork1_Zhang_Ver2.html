			<h3>misc.</h3>
			<p class="text-light"><u>my notes:</u></p>
			<p class="text-light">She's one of my favorite characters!! I really love her hopefullness and willingness to help people. She's willing to sacrifice herself for others, which is both a positive and negative trait. Her character development through Season 1 - 3 is amazing, and I highly recommend watching it. It may seem like "just a kid show" because of it's animated artsyle, but please give it a chance as it also tackles mature themes in a really cool way.</p>
